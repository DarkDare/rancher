## Adding Hosts
---
<span class="highlight">A host is a Linux machine that is used to deploy and run all your applications. The machine can be physical or virtual, which allows you flexibility of how you want to set up your Rancher instance. </span>

Within Rancher, we provide easy instructions to add your host from the Cloud providers that are supported directly from our UI as well as instructions to add your own host if your Cloud provider is not supported yet.
