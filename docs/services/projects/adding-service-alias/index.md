## Adding Service Alias
---

By adding a service alias on top of a service, it provides easier flexibility when upgrading services. <span class="highlight">Need more details on use case/example</span>

Inside your project, you add a service alias by clicking on the dropdown icon next to the **Add Service** button. Select **Service Alias**. Alternatively, if you are viewing the projects at the project level, the same **Add Service** dropdown is visible for each specific project.

You will need to provide a **Name** and if desired, **Description** of the service. The **Name** will be the service alias for the service that you select. 

Select the target(s) that you want to add the alias to. Finally, click **Create**.

The list of services that the alias is serving is shown in the service view. Just like our services, you will need to have the service alias started before it is working.
